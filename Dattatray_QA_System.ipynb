The staff is terribly unfriendly and nobody seems to care.\", 'Terrible customer service. .I came in at 9:30pm and stood in front of the register and no one bothered to say anything or help me for 5 minutes. .There was no one else waiting for their food inside either, just outside at the window. . I left and went to Chickfila next door and was greeted before I was all the way inside. This McDonalds is also dirty, the floor was covered with dropped food. Obviously filled with surly and unhappy workers.', 'First they \"lost\" my order, actually they gave it to someone one else than took 20 minutes to figure out why I was still waiting for my order.They after I was asked what I needed I replied, \"my order\".They asked for my ticket and the asst mgr looked at the ticket then incompletely filled it.I had to ask her to check to see if she filled it correctly.She acted as if she couldn\\'t be bothered with that so I asked her again.She begrudgingly checked to she did in fact miss something on the ticket.So after 22 minutes I finally had my breakfast biscuit platter.As I left an woman approached and identified herself as the manager, she was dressed as if she had just awoken in an old t-shirt and sweat pants.She said she had heard what happened and said she\\'d take care of it.Well why didn\\'t she intervene when she saw I was growing annoyed with the incompetence?', \"I see I'm not the only one giving 1 star. Only because there is not a -25 Star!!! That's all I need to say!\", 'Well, it\\'s McDonald\\'s, so you know what the food is. .This review reflects solely on the poor service. .I have been to this location countless times over the years. .They consistently fail on the service end of things. .The order takers tend to be rude, no smiles, and a lot of \"sighs\" and \"lip smacking\" when you talk to them. .So why go back you ask? This store benefits from being the only place to eat in this area. .The next stop is at least 12 minutes away on the other side of town. .Also I strongly believe in 2nd chances and know that not every business can satisfy everyone 100% of the time. .I have given them many chances at earning a positive review. .I could not recommend this location any less. .If you can wait, take a pass. .There are better McDonald\\'s stores in Griffin, GA.', \"This has to be one of the worst and slowest McDonald's franchises there is. Can't figure out why my Egg McMuffin is always on a stale un-toasted English muffin. Bought A chocolate shake today and threw it away.\", \"I'm not crazy about this McDonald's. .This is primarily because they are so slow. .My gosh what exactly is the hold up? .It's FAST food people. .Also, this morning, I guess the worker thought his mic was off, but it wasn't. .I now know that he is trying to get as many hours as possible because he needs money BAD. .Spread the word. .Anyway, this location is on a little access road .and you have to go back the way you came because there is no exit from it at the other end. .It would have helped if there was one. .So, in the end I think I'll avoid this location and find another. .This should be easy as there is no shortage of Mickey D's in this piece.\", 'One Star and I\\'m beng kind. I blame management. last day of free coffee so \"we\" decide to stop and order breakfast and coffees thru drive-thru. She charged us for coffee and when asked why she said she needed to confirm there were two of us in the car. Now she has to clear the order and that took retraining. Ask next time at tthe speaker.Oh it gets better....We get to next window where Einstein is waiting, pours the coffees with different creams/sugars added. \"Which one is which?\" I asked... and he smiled and said \"One has 2 cream 2 sugar and the other has 3 cream 1 sugar\".. didnt maek the cups... but at least he made sure we had straws for our coffees.... Hello? management? Where are You?', \"Never been upset about any fast food drive thru service till I came to this McDonalds.After a long trip from California my wife and I went to McDonalds for a quick bite to eat before our drive back home. We pull up to the drive thru but there are a lot of cars waiting to order. We were guessing there must be a lot demand for McDonalds at this late hour. So we wait about 5 - 10 minutes for our turn to order. We order the specials they were having at that time (20 pcs chicken nuggets for $5) and asked for a cup of water because we didn't want to drink any sodas at that late hour. They take our order but tells us they don't serve cups of water there. So we are a little annoyed but ok we shrug it off and wait our turn to pay and receive our order. However, we wait for almost another 10 min to finally pay at the first window - then another 5 more min to finally receive our food. By far the worst McDonalds in the world. Unfriendly and slow.\", \"This McDonald's has gotten much better. Usually my order would be wrong every single time so I would not leave that window until I checked every single item. I only hit up fast food once a month or so and it needs to be worth it. Also the fries used to be cold and the cheese on the burger was never melted. Everything was just lukewarm. Now my order has been right a few times in a row and my food hot. Also, I love dining room. Usually you wouldn't find me actually inside a fast food joint but this place has nice flooring, stacked stone, lots of large windows and a flat screen TV usually on HLN. Sometimes its nice to sneak away for a quick weekend breakfast, you know, a little budget and time friendly mommy and me date.\", \"Let's start here only reason I came into McDonald's waste time till girlfriend flight arrives and .for my duaghters. I don't eat fast food ordered two happy meals slow service... While ordering my food .a guy ask the cashier two use his cell in the middle of my order that was strike one then give me little boy toys knowing I have twin girls stabding right in front of him. Im glad I will never have to return here I live way in sandy springs.... I can see the difference between service and the staff The building it self is brand new change your staff this is Blackmac not McDonald's im black myself but telling the truth\", \"Other businesses throughout Metro Atlanta opened their doors to stranded motorists during the Jan. 2014 snow storm. This McDonald's on Camp Creek Parkway told .a group of senior citizens who were on the way home from an outing that they had to leave their restaurant. .All they cared about was the dollar. .After they got that, they were done with them. .Too bad they couldn't have made it down the street to Wendy's or Chic Fil A and other restaurants.\", \"The drive thru makes them lost a star since my last review.This is one of those two lane drive thrus, and I know that the function of that is so that the orders are not messed up when you get to the window, but almost everytime, the cashier ends up asking me what did I order. .I inquired about that before and was told, that when someone drives off that messes up the order.Well, I guess there's no controlling drive off, and at least I know my order has been confirmed, so it should be right by the time I get to the second window.This McDonald's, also has a late night drive thru Thur - Sat, it use to be a 24 hour on those days, but I don't think it is any longer. One of my biggest pet peeves is that the drive thru staff has no smile in their voice. When you are ordering food from the luxury of your vehicle you want to think that the person in charge of taking your order is in good spirits, but not at this location.\", 'Believe it or not, this used to be q really good McDonalds. The drive throuh is so slow, it is frustrating but the service is always friendly. Food is normally luke warm. My niece likes the toys from McDonalds, I wonder if I pull up to the window and say, let me just get the toy, woulf service be faster?', 'As the previous yelpers have already stated, this place is pretty slow.

Well then don\\'t ever go through this drive thru. .Hands down this is the slowest McDonald\\'s drive thru I\\'ve experienced in Atlanta. .Considering this location is close to the airport it would be great if they could simply improve the quality of service. .As a lover of Sweet Tea, I was completely turned off by this location when I overheard the drive thru operator joking about how sweet it was a few years ago. .She told a few of her associates that it was like \"syrup\" and \"liquid diabetes\". By the time I took my first and only sip, I was on I-285 headed to Perimeter Mall and it tasted like cold syrup! .Thank goodness for the McDonald\\'s near Perimeter Mall because they refilled my drink. So the moral to the story is, if you\\'re on Camp Creek Pkwy near the airport, bypass McDonald\\'s and head for Chick-fil-A. #EatMoreChicken', 'This is the worst McDonalds I have ever seen. .The service was terrible and the employees were either lazy or incompetent. I will never return to this establishment.', \"I had the McCafe Mocha and must say that it was better than drinking sand and salt water, that's about it.Too sweet and I couldn't even taste the coffee over the other weird flavors going on in this drink.Stick with the Starbucks mocha, folks. .Trust me on this one.\", 'GHETTO!! went in yesterday just to get a soda and could not even park in handicap parking spot because their delivery truck was blocking all spaces. .Finally made it inside and it was about 5 customers to one cashier. The shift manager made the comment that the car that was waiting needed to be pulled up because they are holding up her line. .Now how is that when they are waiting on their order...hell I was thinking you are holding up the customer and the others waiting.! Anyway finally placed order and was told $1.07, which I paid exact price. Here is where its sad...the cashier did not ring up the soda so therefore I did not get a receipt. I know that she planned to pocket the money, which is sad and bad because eventually that cost will get passed off to customers through price increases. I will not return here because I don\\'t like to feel like I am in someone\\'s \"hood\" and I HATE A THIEF!!! maybe I will call to tell them but then again they probably don\\'t care or maybe even steal themselves. .plus I do not eat fast food anyway so no need to waste precious minutes', 'I visited mcdonalds on Dec 20, 2011 at 12:54 I bought 3 cheese burgers 2 large fries and 2 orders of pies. .They charged me for 3 fries so I went back into store and told the cashier. She denied I said . I ordered 2 fries. .Then manager came over and said whats the problem. I told him and he said looked into the bag, grabbed the xtra fries and lterally threw them into the waste bucket by the drive tru from the cashier . .Then reached into cash register and gave me change for the fries. .Then i said thank you and he said ok boss and I left. .I then called mcdonalds people via the nimber on the website after I ate. I told then I was going to wait to yelp after I heard from McDonalds. .Still no call or email. .As a side note ...Tom N. .(the otther yelper) is right, they are very rude there and seem bothered to help you and not at all nice to the kids. .The play room is sticky and the video games in ther always cause an altercation with kids and parents. .The only reason I gave 2 stars was because the fries were hot and the sweet potatoe fries were good and warm.', 'I usually hit the drive thru once or twice a week for breakfast. A lot of times the forget to include the hash brown if I order a meal. If I order hot cakes they usually forget either butter or utinsils prompting me to have to go inside. The food is also very inconsistent.', \"What a joke.Don't do take out as you will not get anything that you ordered. We prefers and paid for items only to get home with 50% of the order accurate. I've been there numerous times and sadly the same thing happens. It's my fault because I should learn.Does anyone know the owner?I can't believe that he would like this comment. Woodstock Macdonalds is not the place that Ray Crock invented. Save yourself the frustration and waste if money, don't go there!I've learned now.\", 'I wish I can give zero stars. Freezing cold reheated soggy fries and twice fried chewy nuggets = straight to my trash can.', \"I agree with most reviewers on this one.

They are also down the street from my house. You might just want to go to the next McDonald's down the street, less than half a mile maybe. It's brand new and just opened. The reviews here speak for themselves. NO CUSTOMER SERVICE WHATSOEVER. they always rush you at drive-thru and never get the meal correct because they are all ignorant fucks who can't speak proper English or don't even know English. They don't even give you time to respond on an order completion. I've dined inside and it was fine, however it was dirty around me on most occasions. But 99% of the time I eat there, MY MEAL IS ALWAYS INCORRECT! Always! It's ridiculous! I found out it's an ongoing problem; especially at this store. The fries are always pre sorted and they are a hot or miss. They are really good or really bad, which is really annoying. The sandwich is the same, sometimes they put fresh dripping meat on the bun and it makes it soggy, which is disgusting. Most of the times the sandwich is just plain incorrect. I've had to call corporate about the poor customer service I've had with employees and several managers at this location; as well as the constant issue of my order being messed up (which is very inconvenient in drive-thru).

In food quality and employee humanity/work effortTypically, I do NOT eat McDonalds food; yet similar to the experience of others \"trapped\" at Northside Hospital there is no other option if you are hungry outside of the hospital cafeteria hours of operation. Due to a relatives stay and my visits/overnights for 11 weeks~ I too found myself \"trapped\" and therefore forced to buy at McDonalds. Mostly my visits were for coffee or ice cream sundaes. However, last night, for the first time I ordered food (grilled chicken salad) I returned it ~ the meat smelled BADLY. This did not surprise me and only enforced my resolve to avoid chain food restaurants.What did surprise me and absolutely SHOCKED me was the customer service offered by employees ~ HOW in the world can you BE an employee here and NOT for ONE MINUTE or even a second acknowledge the obvious FACT that you work inside a HOSPITAL; then consider what that means for each and every person that approaches your counter to order. HOW you do not SEE them, in FACT that you easily DISMISS them, is beyond my comprehension to understand! HOW you lost your sense of humanity, in all honestly should cause you to pause and contemplate this ~ Are you not aware that you are reflecting how YOU measure within YOU your own sense of dignity?Within my and family/friends of patient at Northside Hospital for the past 11 weeks: each and every time I/they had to place an order I /they was/were subjected to McDonalds toxic business model (in food) which now has transferred (we learned) into their employees. NOT once was I thanked for giving my order; NOT ONCE was I thanked when delivered my order. Yet, at EVERY visit I WAITED and witnessed employee behaviors that were readily displayed and relayed in body language, effort toward actual work, and obvious attitude not only toward me, but guests in front of me. God forbid I happened to have question in reference to the menu (employee response: blank stare, shrug, looking behind them at menu only to turn back around with a blank stare and/or shrug again). .God forbid, on separate occasions I happened to ask for a spoon/napkin/straw. Last night, I happened to ask for my drink please (after receiving my salad and waiting for longer than normal) YIKES, you think I had asked him to draw blood!.One more detail regardless if I arrive at 2am, 4am or between 7:30 pm ~ 11 pm this McDonalds is ALWAYS consistently FILTHY! Not just dirty, but FILTHY!Can anyone lift a broom to sweep up the garbage in the service/cooking area; also in the dining room?Can anyone clean the crud surrounding the plastic display case for cookies ALREADY? It\\'s been 11 weeks and that crud is STILL smeared dried; just gross.Wash/disinfect the countertops, payment pads, straw holders, everywhere spills occur; including areas customers touch. EVERY HOUR! Get it? Every single hour! GET a cleaning ONLY employee! This employee will do NOTHING but be THE OCD employee you NEED!

However, sometimes, nothing hits the spot like their fries and a Diet Coke. What pushes this location over the edge of some others is the staff. They're always super nice whether it's 10am or 10pm. They don't make you repeat your order 18 times and they get it right. They're also generous with the condiments when you ask for them (and even when you don't!). Unlike some fast food places that stop serving milkshakes after a certain hour because they've already cleaned the machine, they'll make you a milkshake up until they close. Service is a huge thing for me so the fact that they're always smiling and ready to help me get my fat fix is what makes me partial to this particular location.

By the time I got around to the window, the person that was to take my money and give me my food was way more interested in an argument that was going on outside in the parking lot between two young ladies and the two young men they were with.I'll admit that I too paid attention to the fight in the parking lot to make sure it didn't escalate into gunfire with my car sitting center mass of it all. About six months ago, someone told me they got robbed while sitting in the drive thru at this location, but they were there around 2am and my visit was taking place at 6pm, so I wasn't worried about getting robbed as much as I was about getting shot.After making sure that the parking lot was not about to be shot up, he accepted my cash, asked me if I wanted to wait a minuite and get some hot fries. .I did, and I did.Sure I'll go back. .I love McDonald's fries. 18 of 100\", 'Of course this is a fast food restaurant so of course there\\'s not much of a spectacular review that I can write but I will express my concerns.

There is a Vons, a Port of Subs, a Panda Express, an Ensteins Bagels, 2 Pizza Places, and a couple of other restraunts all in the same shopping center so just keep pushing business away to your competitors.Monday June 9, 2014 10:45 am\", \"This is hands down the WORST McD's location.I keep saying I wont go back but I think what keeps me going back is that living in the heart of Summerlin there isn't much of an option besides the Burger King on Town Center.The drive-thru is always so so so long and the workers at the window are so slow and seem like it is their first day every time. My order is NEVER right! I order a McGriddle and get a McMuffin WTH! The food is either overcooked or not accurate. What is with the coke? It always and I mean always tastes weird.I have sent an e-mail through the website complaining and they said since nobody else complained about the coke it must be fine. WRONG! If you get the nasty coke please send them an e-mail if enough people complain they might actually do something!!I usually go to the location on Charleston but since this one is so close I do still come here when I have coupons but I make sure and go inside where I can verify my order.\", \"I don't know what it is about this McDonald's. It's like kids run the joint. Not that they aren't friendly, but too many of them just aren't professional, and seem to think the customers are part of their entertainment. This job is basically an extension to their social life. .It's a problem.\", \"Service is terribly slow. Orders have never been correct. Manager Oscar is trained in a third world country.

WHO's the manager? I didnt see one person that was capable of being in charge of running that place. Next tiem I decide to go to Mcdonalds by my job I will hop on the freeway and go to another one and still return to work faster then running across the street to this one!!!!!!\", \"Honestly McDonalds is a McDonalds but I've never been to one so slow. Went in to grab some breakfast and, although no one was there, it still took 20 min. The fact that I keep coming back is just because it is close.\", 'Went through the Drive-thru today at about 11:15 am for lunch. Ordered the habanero quarter pounders and a caramel sundae. Sundae machine was down, so no sundae. I should have taken that as an omen and just left. Got the promo to buy a quarter pounder & get one free. When I went to eat my sandwich I had to search for the habanero sauce( just a touch was on the bun), and the burger was dry as hell and tasted like it had been reheated from the day before. I took one bite and could barely chew it. I threw them both away. What a waste of gas and time. Never going to this place again ... .AWFUL', \"I don't know what the deal is with this location, but they are ridiculously slow! Even if my order is a pre made salad and iced coffee and there is no one else in the drive-thru lane, it still takes forever!\", 'Don\\'t tell anyone but I like McDonald\\'s coffee better than Starbucks. I rather have McDonald\\'s coffee over any other coffee in the world. This McDonald\\'s location would have gotten 5 stars about 3 months ago, but things have changed. A few months ago, the workers were really cool, but now they have all just gotten really f*cking weird! It\\'s almost like one of those 1980s B-Horror Movies where one of the workers gets infected with the Zombie/Vampire/Werewolf virus and then comes to work the next day and spreads it to all his coworkers. .That\\'s the only logical explanation because every worker here has transformed into McDumbasses!I want to remind you that this is Summerlin, so that means that everyone runs stop signs, no one yields for pedestrians, .and everyone argues over the stupidest most insignificant things. Watch out when you are entering this drive-thru because there is a huge chance that some douchebag in a BMW will run the stop sign in order to cut in front of you.When I drove up to the box, there was no answer. About 2 minutes later I begin hearing a ton of static and then this bizarre sounding guy starts talking in this strange tone. He sounded like a drunk Orson Wells. When I pulled up to the first window to pay, the window slowly slid open to reveal the face of a morbid looking kid with gigantic dilated eyes and one of those horror movie smiles. Immediately he lets out this high pitched: \"reeehhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!\" noise at me. At that particular moment, due to the fear of man-rape, I thought about driving over the planters and escaping. But, he looked so weird that I came to the conclusion that he might have some kind of paranormal super powers and would catch me no matter how fast I drove, so I just sat there and awaited my fate. After about 2-3 seconds he told me how much my coffee cost in a disturbingly soft tone voice, and thankfully he didn\\'t serve me McRape. .When I drove up to the pick-up window, I was greeted by an anorexic looking latino kid who didn\\'t even give me eye contact, and while holding the coffee he sticks his arm out the window and just drops it before I even have the chance to reach out to grab it. It was a miracle that I caught the thing in mid air. .I was glad to get the McF*ck out of there.', 'Awful service and extremely slow. Go elsewhere.', 'I love Mcdonalds, grew up on it and still take my boys there regularly and I have to say this. .The location off of the circle in Summerlin really has some hard times keeping up. .The place always seems to be a bit dirty both in the lobby and behind the counter. .I dread getting a \"quick\" bite with the boys when we are in a hurry as they are never fast in the drive thru!! .BUT the food is always just as good at any other Mcdonalds, so they do have that going for them!! .It is literally though one of the slowest mickey D\\'s I have ever been to. .And this is not just one experience, I go very regularly because as I said I love it and this one is the closest to me, so for convenience, but sometimes I wonder if it would be faster to drive seven minutes out of my way to another mcdonalds....Their Employees are so nice though, just not the best on the speed side of things!Maybe they will get better!', \"I've never tried a McRib Sandwich and I heard via the Talk Threads that McDonald's in Las Vegas started serving them the other day, so I took my Son here to give this legendary Sandwich a try.We ordered two McRib Meals (Sandwich, Fries, Soda) $4.19. .I also wanted to try the $1 Spicy McChicken Sandwich.The verdict......I didn't like the McRib at all...blech! .The Sauce was the best part about it. Other than that, it was pretty bland. .The Fries were good of course....and the Spicy McChicken Sandwich was decent, not bad for $1.Overall, it was a complete waste of calories. .I'm not dinging McDonald's for my stupid curiosity, so they get 3 Stars. .The McDonald's experience was A-OK. Did I find value in my meal? .Not today....my fault though.Will I return? .I'd come back again to order something I enjoy.\", 'Pretty good service for fast food.', 'The drive through line is terrible. They are painfully slow.', \"This has to be the WORST McDonalds within a 3,000 mile radius. The staff are young, rude, untrained kids from the local middle school and the drive-through is really painfull. This location should be closed down or sold to someone who knows how to run a McDonalds. They're always out of something, there's never a cashier in the first drive- through window (where your supposed to pay) so people sit in their cars and wait for a cashier to magically appear to take their money..not happening! So then you decide to walk in to order thinking you'll get your order faster and not missing something..WRONG! As you stand there and wait for them to make and bag your order your watching the car that would have been behind you, in the drive-through, leave. WTF! Next time, I'm getting Mexican food!\", \"Years of pathetic service, disgusting food, and dangerous mistakes. Why do I keep going back?Having nothing to do with Mcdonalds food in general and more to do with the ability of this specific location to produce it with out killing anybody. I have been going to this particular store for years. It is right around the corner from where I used to live, and is on the way from where I live to pretty much everything I use (gas station, costco, movie theater, market, etc). It is the only convenient location, and for a while Mcdonalds was the only place that had $1 drinks. So those are my lame excuses for repeatedly torturing myself with this horrible place! Service: I used to be a manager with another fast food chain. I know what service SHOULD be. I also know what it usually is. It doesn't have to be 5 star. But the rude attitudes, ridiculously slow service, and inability to get a single order right is really a bit too much. When I say slow service, I am talking 15 minutes is average drive thru time for a dollar menu burger and a soda. Correct orders: Yes, my order can occasionally be complicated (no castup, add big mac sauce)... but when I thought they could do no worse... they messed up an order for 4 large drinks. 2 diet cokes, a lemonade, and an unsweet iced tea (all with extra ice). We received a regular coke, a lemonade, a Dr. Pepper, and a sweet iced tea. 2 drinks had no ice at all. and the other 2 had a few pieces floating around. We have never received a correct order from this store. EVER. I could go on and on about it, but I will stick with this sad example and move on.Dangerous/disgusting/incorrectly made: Something a little different then an order where they put the wrong thing in the bag or mess up a custom, is when they just make it incorrectly or dangerously. Some of the examples of this include pies that expired an hour before I received them, an egg that was completely raw in the middle, and tonights lovely mess up. Tonight I ordered the Angus Mushroom and Swiss. According to the website this should include 2 full slices of swiss cheese and a decent amount of mushrooms. I had about a teaspoon of mushrooms, no sauce, and 1/2 a slice of cheese. That is right, they left off a slice and a half of cheese! In addition, it was a regular (and relatively old) quarter pound patty, not the big ole angus patty they should have used. I have called the number on the receipt multiple times that takes me to the district office. They consistently send out a free sandwich or drink coupon to apologize. They tell me how sorry they are and suggest I try one of their other locations, as this is the only one they receive complaints from. From what I was told they are revamping this store, but I have been told that for well over a year, and it seems to have been unvamped and going down hill, which I didn't think was even possible! I keep vowing this will be my last visit, but then find myself sitting in the drive thru line yet again wondering if I will ever receive my food. I highly do not recommend this location. Hopefully you won't be lured in by whatever the heck keeps luring me! -Sarah (This was written by Paul's wife because I am usually the one dealing with them. I guess he got smarter.)\", \"My drive through experience was a pleasant one. The workers seemed very friendly and I received quick service.

Ice cream machine is out.Instead, we get two large sweet teas.....Which were overly sweet. Almost...gave off a syrup feel after I swallowed.Tonight, the ice cream machine IS working, so I get two sundaes, and of course, two large sweet teas.Sundaes look sad, because they are not in their proper clear plastic cup...they are instead in mini McFlurry cups....(not even filled completely, might I add.)My friend and I take one sip of our sweet teas....and they taste like dirty water.It's almost like they were trying to trick us.....Like, they didn't have enough tea, so they filled 3/4 of the cup with water.... Seriously, if I wanted the taste of unfiltered water, I would just pick up a hose out of someone's back yard. The women who work here, hate their lives.

Essentially I had the choice of getting a sweet tea or a Coke product with my breakfast sandwich and hash brown. Now that I have experienced sweet tea with a sausage egg biscuit I can say with all certainty that these two items should not be served together.This particular McDonald's does not exude any of McDonald's core philosophies such as variety or efficiency. It seems poorly stocked, poorly operated and under maintained. The bathrooms are filthy and I would suggest buying a cheap pair of socks for your child because their socks will be coated in dirt after 5 minutes of playing. The only thing that was good about my visit was my sausage egg biscuit sandwich. The hash brown tasted as though it had fried in old rancid oil.

It was 5:00 AM and although our appetites were ginormous, our options were limited. We happened upon this McDonald's where they were offering double cheeseburgers for $0.99. I ordered three. My companions followed suit. We sat down among the other customers: three older men sparsely seated and desperate to stay awake lest they be thrown out in the street amongst the crumpled pornographic business cards. One man chewed with his eyes closed. Another bobbed his head up and down. Either he was falling in and out of sleep or agreeing with everything.

Our larger truck fit through, so that is a good thing.The first trip, my husband, also sick, drove off as soon as the food was handed to us. I'm all like what are doing? I haven't tried the fries yet! Anyway, the fries were either over cooked,( I don't think so), or cooked twice. The amount of salt was unreal and the fries were cooked beyond crispy.Second trip, the fries looked like McDonalds fries just not very warm, and yes he drove off before I tried one. We get back to the R.V. resort we're staying at and I try my Big Mac, almost no sauce and very bland. The patties also look like they have gotten smaller.The two ladies at the window were not overly friendly but not rude either. If you want a burger just stop at In and Out across the street.\", 'Go the the rainbow location instead. This location constantly forgets napkins and the staff is rarely friendly. Worth it to just drive a couple miles to the other location.', \"By far the WORST McDonald's I've ever been to!!! .If I could give it less then one star I would. .I live right down the street so this is the easiest McDonald's to get to, but ever time I go the wait is ridiculous, the serve is horrible, and the food is thrown together! .I suggest everybody go to the McDonald's off rainbow instead because it going to take just as long either way. . And their staff is a lot more friendly!!\", \"I was so excited for this McDonalds to open, it's about time we get a food place in that location. So you can imagine my disappointment with their terrible service and bad quality food making!! Worst. Worst. Worst. I get they are new. I do, so the first few times I went, I kept my cool, didn't complain, smiled, etc. I like to go mid-morning on my way to work for either just coffee and a Sausage McMuffin with no egg... How complicated of an order can it be??!! Sometimes I will mix it up and get a combo meal, this is usually where they royally screw it up. I'm irritated just thinking about the visits Ive had and how 4 out of 5 visits they screwed something up. To make this brief, here are my major issues. I order Splenda to be added to my drink. I'm in my work clothes, and I don't want to pull over and carefully add it myself and spill on my clothes since they A) they always fill it too high, and B) I don't want to make any more stops! Cheese: hardly ever melted on the Quarter Pounder, or Big Mac and I've tried about 3 or 4 times. Cheese not melted, or the tiniest blob of sauce! I wanted the new habanero ranch, couldn't even taste the sauce except for one bite! Plus it was luke-warm at least twice! The hot & spicy with a tiny splash of mayo? I mean, really! I ordered an iced Caramel Mocha, get to the window, she hands me the latte, it had no caramel on the whip, so I ask, is this the Caramel Mocha? She stares at me blankly and says yes, I say, I'm used to it having caramel on top, she says its a caramel mocha, so off to work I go, I'm already late because they are super SLOW, and sure enough take a sip after I'm gone and it's a regular mocha. Pathetic service!I did write in to corporate after my 8th or 10th attempt to do business there.. And the manager called me and apologized. Told me to come in and get a free combo on him. So not happening. Go in so they can remember me as the Girl who called them out for their shit slow service, always messing up my orders, .and crap food making? No thanks. I would have rather had some coups sent so I could remain anonymous. Oh well. I just drive a few more blocks down to Rainbow and Blue Diamond location if i have the extra time, they are great! As for this place? Shame on you for STILL not being able to get your shit together! One positive note I will say is there are two very friendly employees there. They work the drive thru taking orders/$$ I wish I had their names! Will I be back? Sadly probably yes, it's very convenient for me on my way to work when I don't have time to go to rainbow location.. But I limit what I get, try to keep it simple and always hope for the best... Maybe someday they will be a great location... As for now? The McDonald's Corporation would be ashamed!!!\", \"Not a lot I can say because I seriously visit McDonald's locations for one thing only: the Vanilla Reduced Fat Ice Cream Cone! It is very delicious, just one dollar (range between 99 cents to $1.29, not including sales tax), and just 170 calories! I cannot complain. We went through the Drive-Thru for our first visit and it went smoothly. Short wait with just 3-4 cars ahead of us.

I get it, it's where kids play, but shit clean it up. The girl who takes your order inside or at the drive thru has an attitude problem. The one that hands you the food has an attitude problem. Then they get mad when you ask for an extra condiment. As if it came out of their pay check. I can't wait for the other one to open up down the street. I rather make the drive. Get it together.\", 'Super slow!!! Been here 6x and they never get my order right!!! Will never come back here! I always ordered well done fries and I always get saggy fries that probably been sitting around for more than an hour. ~__~ I went to go to drive thru and the lady told me to wait 10 minutes at front parking lot 18minutes later still nothing so I decided to go drive at the drive thru. The lady told me to go back to the front and wait 10 minutes I told her I\\'ve been waiting for 18 minutes. They so slow!!! And probably not even doing their job. I own the business across the street and they always waste my time. Today, I asked for that Oreo mcflurry I think and they said \"Yes\" they have some so it\\'s cool, then when I went to pay, they told me \"I\\'m sorry we don\\'t have some at the moment and we will refund your money and you can take the rest of your order at the 2nd window\" ~__~ whoever the manager here for sure doesn\\'t know how to manage.

So, while waiting for my mom which I dropped her off at Valley Hospital, I decided to go through the drive through. I ordered a kids meal and 2 big mac's with extra sauce, which I got charged extra for and I've never been charged before. There were a few cars in front of me but it went by quick. I pull up to the window for my food and ask the guy at the window which toy they had, as I always do. sad to say he didn't have much but one toy not even the special toy for kids under 3.

That is I like this one here.\", \"I was not impressed with my visit this time to this location. Suprisingly it was by someone who is a shift manager who was working the window. How can you take my order over the speaker and still have a conversation with another employee? It took her several tries to get my order right!! Then when I get to the window she doesn't even say hi or tell me my total just puts her hand out for payment. As I gave her my card I asked her to please give me jelly and extra syrup and butter. All she did was smile when I said thank you. Took them a good 15 minutes to get my stuff as she was a way from window by the inside counters talking to employees. When she finally gave me my order I reasked that I got the jelly and syrup and she goes to reach to get some and then says OH its in the bag. Now I ordered Big Breakfast with Hotcakes and Bacon, two sausage and egg mcmuffins, hashbrown and a coke. When I got home I got everything BUT the HASH Browns!!!! I was to get two of them one with the Big Breakfast and the extra one I ordered. UGGG it was on my receipt. the name on the receipt stated KS #15. So not right especially by someone in Management\", \"I used to go to this one a lot (when fast food was a regular staple in my diet, in my 20's, when my metabolism was faster, and when exercise was not such a priority)- this is one of the older ones in town. Recently, we went through the Drive-Thru window for some fruit smoothies. There were a couple cars in front of us. Clear mike, speedy checkout, nice girls, the correct order, and great-tasting smoothies. We only go to McD's for a few things (parfait, cone, and sometimes the breakfast sandwich) and even then, it's pretty sporadic- maybe a few times a year, because of the lifestyle changes we made since maintaining our weight.\", 'I don\\'t think this McD has ever been remodeled. Other than a badass painting of the McKingdom, there was another thing hanging on the wall which was pretty much a quilt with like cactus (cacti) sewn in to it and there was another case that had a bunch of old pins and buttons and I don\\'t think there was a pin that was made later than 1982 or something. One was for \"McDonalds Pizza\"This thing (the painting) was pretty badass though, that\\'s why I took the pic. It\\'s like 10\\' x 6\\'. I think it was dated 1979. Which makes sense considering that Mayor McCheese is there and the McKingdom is there tooI swear that place has been forgotten in time. Not only did it have the vintage artwork but the soda fountain was probably from the 80\\'s as well because the ice machine and sodas were completely separate machines and there was a pay phone outside but it wasn\\'t right outside the store, it was across the parking lot kind of in the bushes and had some weird phone company that I never heard of on it. Plus it had an electronic sliding door on the main entrance and the \"Play Place\" was outdoors and even had a sing that said \"Please Do Not Feed The Birds\". Such a weird place. It\\'s cool because it reminds of the way McDonald\\'s was when I was a kid but it\\'s scary because it\\'s not intentionally retro, it just never changed...It\\'s quite the experience.

Normally, I pay using my debit card but on this occasion I had cash. So here comes the disappointment... As the cashier goes to hand me my change she drops some of it!

She didn't open the drawer and give me correct change nothing she dropped my change and kept it pushing! I've never experienced this before. They have always corrected the change when THEY drop it. I mean she dropped it before I even put my had out the cat window. I'm like come on now... I didn't drop it! Its not MY fault. Urgh! Anyways this experience was overall annoying and off putting!\", \"I think that the preparation was a tad lacking. I used to work at a Mc D's when I was in high school. It was the perfect job for a kid. .Anyway, my filet was lopsided. It was half way off the bun and my cheese was melted three quarters off the fish. The tartar was every where and my fries were all mushy. I can't expect much from a Mc D's but goodness. There are some interesting folks who come in and out of here.

For instance, the daughter was hungry and I was in a rush to get ready for an event and this McDonald's was across from SLS, which at the day of our visit to McDonald's was not open yet and therefore did not have functional restaurants yet. We went through the drive thru and it was easy and manageable.This is a typical McDonald's with nothing to make them more memorable than other locations (in a good or bad way). But if you are staying in the vicinity and in need of fast food, do try them. Their drive thru is also open 24 hours so they are very convenient if you need calories late at night (which happens a lot in Las Vegas, go figure!). Overall, not a bad McDonald's.\", \"Fast food typically just is what it is, but this particular McDonald's was awful.The service was terrible, .the cashier had an attitude not only with me but pretty much every customer that came through her line in the 15 minutes I waited to get my food (basic big mac & fries, nothing special). She forgot to give me my drink and when I asked her for it she tried to give me the size below what I ordered. When I asked for the right size she practically insisted I take the smaller one. Then when my order was up and I asked for ketchup, she rolled her eyes and acted like I was making her go so far out of her way to reach under the counter. Then, when I went to the fountain to get my drink, there were small bugs flying all around it.Best part was when I got back and ate my food and realized that my fries were cooked in the same fryer the do the fish in. Pretty sure those are supposed to be separate. Threw those out, so ended up not needing the ketchup anyways. Definitely do yourself a favor and go to a different location.\", \"This is the absolute worst McDonald's I have ever been to in my entire life! This place was filthy.

Here it goes:Visit #1: Fool me once...shame on you.My husband and I head to the room early our first night in Vegas because we were tired after a long drive. After watching some TV my husband said he wanted a little something from our local McDonalds. I was not really hungry but I was craving a little something sweet so I asked him to get me a McFlurry and to call me and tell me what kind they have. He calls and they have Oreo, M&M, and Butterfinger. YUM! I want Butterfinger I exclaimed! He hangs up and calls back about a minute later to break the news to me that they are out of Butterfinger. That would've been useful info to have when he first asked! So I ended up with Oreo. He comes back and I take a bite of my McFlurry. For those who may not know a McFlurry is soft serve icecream mixed with whatever topping you get. How do you possibly mess that up? Messing up a McFlurry is equal to the stupidity of burning cornflakes! There is no excuse. I took one bite and threw it away. The icecream was warm and the oreo chucks were stale. NASTY! My husband's burger and fries turned out ok at least. Visit #2: Fool me twice....shame on me. After some late night gambling I was hungry and did not feel like searching for late night eats so I ventured into this hell hole again. I figured since I was getting regular food this time it would be ok. The customer service of this place is atrocious. You are pretty much the only 24 hour operation that offers more than donuts and coffee so change your attitude. My husband had a sweet tooth this time and wanted a McFlurry. Dun Dun Dun! I order my food and ask for a Oreo McFlurry and the guy behind the counter proceeds to tell me that the icecream machine is locked. Excuse me? WTF? I call my hubby and tell him and he is most displeased. After two minutes of straight .cursing he asks for chocolate chip cookies, they have none. The only had oatmeal raisin which I can only describe is the asshole of cookies. So literally they have no good desserts. So my poor baby goes without what he wants. We are not doughnut fans so Krispy Kreme is not really appealing. After that I was done with that place for good!If you are ok with McDonalds go to the one at The Luxor. You will probably get better service. We should've. .If you want something better venture into NYNY into America cafe which is open 24 hours and for the same price you can get some decent food and service.\", \"This is a lousy McDonalds.

He ended up waiting over 30 minutes in line to get 2 egg Mcmuffins and coffee, and I had to wander out of the room to see what the hold up was. There was also no dollar menu available when we were there, so we ended up paying the $3 for a greasy sandwich.

I have a rule for myself. I never fight with people that make my food behind closed doors. Yea, maybe paranoid but sadly its a reality. So I was completely polite about canceling my order. I do believe they did the right thing by offering me these breakfast items. Where i find the problem is the simple lack of customer service. That conversation of them no longer serving breakfast was one we should have never had. Implying that my order was an inconvenience when clearly It shouldn\\'t have been.

We drove to this establishment, as it was nearest to the drug den that I had just left. Purple haze ringing in my nostrils and Nickelback blaring from the Hummer H2 behind me, I ordered my delicacy. Upon arriving at the window, I was shocked to find that the Americans with Disabilities Act applies to people who were born sideways with three umbilical cords wrapped around their extra chromosome. Good job being progressive giants, McDonalds. UNFORTUNATELY, this coke bottle glasses-wearing invalid decided to give me, a man with nary a possession to his name, a medium fry trapped indecently in a complex puzzle box constructed from bags that had clearly formerly hosted the cursed sperm sample that grew his hairy greasy ass in a test tube in Santa Monica.

We were greated by a big man who had a very poor attitude. I thought maybe he was just having a bad night?? As we pulled to the counter to grab our order a car from the drive thru went around us to leave. He actually yelled at the man who takes orders that he needed to learn how to treat customers. I then knew that the rudeness that was suspected was not just my imagination.. Tonight was the absolute last time I will ever go here.. We went thru the drive thru around 12:00 AM and for some reason the man who normally takes the order said that they would be closed for 15 minutes for a break??? This is supposed to be a 24 hour location. I wasn\\'t sure if he said 15 or 50 minute break so I asked him when they would re-open to have him yell 15 back in the headset? Some seriously bad service.

The McDonald Playland is nonexistent. What does exist is a chandelier and a more elegant lobby. They did not go modern to the point of some restaurants that feature the super Coke machines with a 100 plus flavors. The typical Coke flavors they had were not flat.

I never became a professional chef, but I continue to enjoy & love food. 9 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I have a new passion for traveling and trying different foods around the world.\", \"This place is very hit and miss to me come on it's McDonald's not a five-star restaurant I .understand but classic whoever's working determines on quality of food or them to get your order correct\", \"This place is so unprofessional!

Used the drive thru, there was hardly a wait. Staff was pleasant but the stench of moth balls was unbearable when they opened the drive up window. Yuk!

I ordered a spicy chicken sandwich with no mayo and a medium fry with a side of BBQ sauce. heres what i gota spicy chicken sandwich with tons of mayo and a broken bun because of all the disgusting white shit everywhere. a medium fry that was literally half full, honestly me saying it was half full was exaggerating, it was about a third full. and guess what no BBQ sauce BUT an open ketchup packet that got everywhere.

The wait time depends on when you actually order. It's a little longer in the morning when everyone is off to work and when people are getting off work.

The burger was your typical McD's burger, nothing special, tastes like a very cheap, almost beef patty. The fries however, looked and tasted like they had been dropped into the fryer a couple times. Finally, the soda... there was a slightly off taste to it, could be the mix, or the syrup was on its way out, either way, it wasn't the greatest tasting soda I have had.After eating, I went to get my drink refilled, as they normally give one refill per cup at this location. Not this time. Now, if you would like a refill, it is $0.54. I was really tempted to break out the credit card to pay for a refill, just out of spite. Laziness prevailed and I walked away.

I am not lying when I say that 7 out of 10 visits whether it be drive-thru or walk-in, something is wrong with my order. I can remember my order for extra onions on McRib sandwiches or hamburgers have been produced with extra pickles and no onions. A recent visit took 25 minutes to produce a 10 piece chicken mcnuggets and a soda. I've worked at a McDonald's before, and if I had a valid food card, and ambassadorial privileges, I could have changed the oil, re-heat the fryer, located a box in their freezer, and fry my own food, and still get to school on time. The shift manager gave me a large fries and 2 cups for drinks, not being sensitive to the fact that I had diabetes, and I had ordered nuggets for speedy service and avoidance of excess carbs.The service today was not as bad, but why do they go through the trouble of asking what kind of sauce do I want with my nuggets if they aren't going to give it to me? The guy at the window actually tried to shove me out of drive-thru with only a partial order. This particular instance has happened several times.Unfortunately, I am a fan of their products, and when I get a hankering and wish not to get out of my vehicle, this is the closest location.I have managed 3 food service installations, and I guarantee that I could run that place better than the current crew, given minimal training.I would say the 80's had lousy fashion, 90's had lousy music, and so far, aside from drivers of today, customer service is at its worst, especially for food service and more especially for McDonald's on Sunset and Stephanie.\", \"Status upon arrival: Hungover, Starving, Filthy, 3 hours of sleep.Even though McDonalds is known to be fast food as in fast service, we love to request our Angus burgers fresh upon order.

Not only was the place very dirty, but the food was terrible. The chicken sandwiches we got were very dry and tasted like some cleaning product that should have been rinsed off the grill.

Yelp wants me to write the review and I am tired of seeing this when I go on the welcome screen. So, I will write a review on the McDonald\\'s in Sam\\'s Town. .When I write a review I try to look at a unique aspect of the business. When it comes to fast food restaurants, it takes some thinking. What makes this McDonald\\'s unique is that it features the exact Western motif displayed throughout Sam\\'s Town. It is incorporated in a food court in back of the mountain where the robotic Mystic Falls robotic animals perform. I don\\'t know of any McDonald\\'s where I could grab a Big Mac and fries and watch a robotic cast of animals performing in a laser show, What also makes this McDonald;s unique for a location off the Strip is that they do not honor the $1 Any Size Beverage promotion. .The Sam\\'s Town McDonald\\'s is one of a few food choices in Sam\\'s Town. In my opinion I pass over their coffee and dessert for Dunkin Donuts. I pass over their lunch and dinner menu for the Firelight Buffet, Panda Express, and Subway. For my tastes, this McDonald\\'s is advantageous for a light snack or a Large Coke for the drive home. The time I spend on the line justifies a check-in. It is the McDonald\\'s of Sam\\'s Town, and it gets busy. In comparison to a similar McDonald\\'s in the D casino, the employees are friendly. This summarizes my experiences for the Sam\\'s Town McDonald\\'s. Yelp should be happy that I wrote the review, and I should be happy to see a new picture on my welcome screen.', \"Manuel, the manager, gave us the worst customer service I've every had at a McDonald's.

Unfortunately, this means that at night, during games and practices, the parking lot is mostly full due to people parking there for their games.Do not let the parking lot fool you if there is a game in progress. It's probably not very packed at all.Another thing relates to the free wifi. They have the power outlets inside ONLY under a large HD tv where they have 4 comfortable chairs set up. This tells me they only want people using the internet over there and not at the tables, keeping the tables open. From a business perspective, this is smart.

I uploaded that photo here at the time of this review but it was originally taken early in the year (mainly because I had another bad experience and I need to tell everyone not to come here any more because they suck.)So the first time, as the photo shows, a dead small black fly on the lettuce in my Classic Crispy Chicken Sandwich. I usually order it without mayo and when I got my sandwich the 1st time, guess what? It had mayo. I just don\\'t get why they can\\'t read instructions properly or anything. Why can\\'t the condiment be separate and not default? It\\'s so frustrating. Any way, 2nd time I got the sandwich, they \"got it right\" except for the fly part. I already went in my car so I said \"F it\" so I just took the picture as proof and then ripped the contaminated area on the lettuce.I didn\\'t go to this location for awhile after this incident, but I was craving Chicken McNuggets and so since it isn\\'t a fresh produce item or whatever, I decided it wouldn\\'t be a big deal. Boy was I wrong. I think this might have happened twice but I counted my nuggets and it was missing 1 in the 10 or 20 piece meal. I shouldn\\'t have to count how many nuggets I have, but sadly these people can\\'t do their job. I don\\'t even get much time to eat lunch so I didn\\'t have time to go back and complain. I\\'m done with this location any way so if I\\'m craving a sandwich or Chicken McNuggets from here, I\\'ll just drive across the bridge and go there because it probably isn\\'t crap like this location. They know they are serving a ton of people since they are the only location but they just do such a bad job. The fries are a bit overpriced too and some other things in case any of you were thinking you can get a decent deal on Large Fries.

Strangely the food is in a box and a carton. This must be a new style , the creativity of chefs these days knows no bounds. I am impressed. I open up the box and there lies this lettucey thing with some kind of salad dressing on it. It is cold and damp. This must be an artistic statement of some kind. Possibly a commentary on the ill treatment of the Intuit natives at the turn of the last century. I am impressed by the chefs social concerns but I had wished that the food was hot. I took a bite . I am glad that I sat close to the toilet as I made a run for it. They must have been upset that I ordered the foie gras originally. They are making me pay for it. I know when I have been defeated. My pomme frites were hot but lacking any French accoutrements. This must be French cooking under the Vichy government when the Germans took away their cream and tried to make them eat sausages.

As some other reviewers have said, the staff have no control over it and it turns into a free-for-all. I honestly think Chicago PD needs to have a few officers staffed inside this place 24/7, since there are always a lot of sketchy things going on.

Long ago, McDonald's revolutionized the restaurant industry with fast food dining, a paragon of what was possible when human ingenuity applied itself to streamline processes and deliver maximum production and food for people in the least amount of time. These days, efficiency no longer matters and has been replaced with indifference, complacency, and a lack of disregard to customer priorities. On most mornings, I will stop into McDonald's to grab a yogurt parfait for $1.12 as my morning breakfast. I did it because it was a healthy breakfast, tasted good, and was amazingly cheap. Before today, one of the top ten things I associate with McDonald's is efficiency, and today I can throw that word out the window because McDonald's no longer merits it.Today I left my house early for the express purpose of ordering more food for breakfast because I didn't have dinner and I was short on sleep and needed a giant coffee to go with some food to keep me sane for a long day at work. I arrived at 8:44am and I know this because Foursquare told me so when I checked in! Something was amiss and there was a large crowd of people and lines that were simply not moving.Great, these things sometimes happen, which was why I was glad that I left my house early so that if I actually did have to wait in line it wouldn't matter and I'd still be able to get what I wanted when I wanted it. The minutes started flying by and the line still wasn't moving! What happened to that proud tradition of corporate efficiency to deliver the customer what they wanted when they wanted with the highest degree of professionalism and courtesy? Well you can all forget about it because it's clear that no one in this McDonald's during the morning shift gives one iota of care for anyone waiting in line.I got to be the third person in line when two customers started to argue with the cashier that they wanted cream on the side of their coffee and not mixed in. The clerk wouldn't make a new coffee for the customers and the customers weren't having any of it. Watching these people argue with the clerk got my blood boiling because I was trying to get an order in and get to work on time! .Because of the inability of the clerk to placate these customers I ended up stuck in line waiting, waiting, and waiting in what seemed to be forever!Having arrived at 8:44am, it was now 8:54am and I hadn't made an order! I yelled in frustration about the utter lack of disregard the staff had much to the amusement of the other patrons who were all either waiting for their order or waiting to order who all were in the same boat. I slammed the door on leaving and walked a block over to Starbucks. At Starbucks I spent $5 for a giant cup of coffee and no food - $5 I could have easily spent at McDonald's in order to get what I wanted, but apparently McDonald's no longer cares about earning my money since they are too busy arguing with other customers and making everyone wait to order and wait for their food. Long gone are the good old days of the quick food restaurant, this McDonald's no longer adheres to any sense of time or service and has degenerated into the ultimate display of incompetency. There are not enough words in all of the languages I speak to describe the disgust that I experienced today at this McDonald's.

(Similarly, waiting 25 minutes for an ice cream cone on another occasion.) - Asking for a Shamrock shake and being told they ran out, only to see two be made and delivered to the customers right in front of me.

But before I could stand up and head on over to the counter I was approached by I believe the manager who didn\\'t start off by saying \"Welcome to McDonalds...\" I instead got, \"Have you ordered yet?\", \"You can only be here 30 minutes\", and went into some speech about ordering, customers and length of time to be there??? I was like WTH?

This was a VERY unpleasant encounter with this manager. I have NEVER just sat in a McDonalds, or any venue and not ordered. I DO NOT LOITER and was quite offended that this person insinuated that. .In fact, I always order and take it home except this day I did sit for a a minute ( and earlier at breakfast I ordered my usual grub and sat maybe 5-7 minutes and took the rest home) or two as I completed my call, but I just got there and it was like this person appeared out of nowhere and started grilling me?

Back in the day, the cheapest place to get a burger and fries was Maxwell's on 31st. In my family during that time, eating at Mcdonalds was luxury item. Why was it a luxury? Because my parents highly frowned upon processed and can foods. As a rebellious child growing up, eat at a Mcdonald's was luxury. The closest place without a car had to be in McKinley Park. Fast forward a few years and the McDonald's express opened. Despite it being fastfood, it poses as a treat to all the locals in the neighborhood; after playing sports at Mcguane or just grabbing a quick bite. This Mcdonald's is very small compared to other Mcdonalds, but they do serve most items. Since they marketed their $1 menu couple of years ago, the dollar menu has never changed. McChickens and Mcdoubles were always a $1. Now with the advertised $1 breakfast menus and any size drink, there are a lot of cheap options. My only grievance is that they don't have sweet tea and salads, but unsweetened tea is available. It doesn't feel right to goto any McDonalds for a salad... it just doesn't make sense to me.I come here a couple times a month for ice coffee, hot coffee and a sandwich or two. The location is convenient to grab a quick bite, pick up my dry cleaning, or pick up a few small items from Walgreens.

All things being fair, the culinary experience was doomed for failure given certain personal and tragic circumstances I won\\'t get into here.Upon stepping to the counter, I gave pause to the abbreviated menu not worthy of a McDonald\\'s Express, which is a new concept to me all-together. I decided to play it safe with the classic cheeseburger meal with an intimidating amount of fries and drink aka \"The Value Meal\". My meal was served up a little too quickly with all due credit to the server. The food seemed to appear from nowhere - gremlins cooking the food? I could see the grease seeping through one of the burger wrappers. At this point I made a snap substitution request, no coke, coffee instead - a hot beverage will make the grease go down smoother. My server obligated me in silence and I acknowledged her generosity. I took my tray and chose a seat by the front windows where parked cars would treat the diner with blinding light from their headlights, but at least it was somewhat devoid of the cold glowing light emitting from the overhead florescent located in the rear of the restaurant.I sat down and emptied the contents of the bag, fries and napkins, no ketchup. I tasted one of the fries to determine if they were worthy of ketchup-free consumption, but alas no, they were slightly cold with a texture that left an unpleasant lump in your throat. I fetched several ketchup packets from the server, kept under tight security behind the counter and returned to my table.Spilling out the ketchup packets on the table, I noticed dried droplets of ketchup on the plastic packets. No turning back now, I dug into my dinner with a overwhelming sadness for humanity and myself. So, to sum up:Fries. They left an odd taste of seafood or fish to my palette. Perhaps they co-mingled food in the fryer. The luke-warm temparture made it a bit difficult to choke them down. Maybe some beer would have helped the process.Cheeseburgers. Lifting the top bun of any burger, you can tell right away if there was any love in the preparation. Though consumable, the burgers were not satisfying and tasted as if they sat under a heat lamp for too long, also lukewarm.Coffee.

This McDonald\\'s is directly across the street from my apartment.So, after witnessing a guy smash his van (we later were told by the po-po that it was stolen) into the light pole right at the corner, then watching him exit the vehicle and run maniacly down North Ave., away from the scene, we decided we were hungry. We thought \"why not go to McD\\'s\". Seems logical. I mean, McD\\'s is always the same no matter where you go, right? And it was certainly conveniently located. At least it appears conveniently located. Oh, its not. Attempting to cross North Ave. at my intersection is really a situation where you are taking your life into your hands. This is a 4, 5, 6, oh hell, I don\\'t even know how many corners there are here, intersection. And one of the lights is only green for one side of the street, but has no sign indicating that anywhere, so people either don\\'t stop or just stand there. You feel like you are playing Frogger. Except not with a pixellated frog, but rather with your own skin and organs.If you make it into the building with your spinal cord still attached to your body, you will see they always have at least 15 people working here. Yet, there are never more than 2 registers open at once. And the only people working those registers are either a. ancient, non-english speaking women b. mentally handicapped. Hey, I appreciate their sense of social responsibility to hire the old and degenerate. I do not appreciate the game of charades I must play with the cashiers to get my order right.While you are waiting the 15 plus minutes it takes to get your food here, you may notice that this McDonalds is a bit different from the rest. Ricky Martin pictures, signed Selena CDs and gigantic Enrique Iglesias are the decor of choice here. Apparantly, this is the Latin Rock n\\' Roll McDonalds. Couple that with the fact that its the only McDonald\\'s I have ever seen that has Jalepeno\\'s as a condiment and the fact that they look at me as if I am lost every time I walk in there, I think its safe to say the clientele here is pretty set.Overall, the location, service and neighborhood sucks.

I thought by turning left onto Kostner (a fairly main-drag kind of street), I could enter (as you could with the old one). .Nope. .No entrance any more on Kostner. .And you cannot turn left from North Avenue to Lowell because there's a median (I think: either way, you're risking an accident or a ticket). .There's an alley directly behind the lot, which is not only fenced off from Mickey D's, but 'one way' going out. .So I drive AROUND THE BLOCK, past Lowell (the one-way street next to McDonald's), to Kildare, back to North Avenue, then enter. .Jesus. .The entrance has one of those divided-curb thingys, which was barely wide enough for my compact car. .There are TWO drive-thru lanes from which to order food, but then they merge into one waiting line, so you can end up in this single line ahead of someone who's been waiting longer, or vice-versa, so why bother? .The rest was standard McDonald's (WHY can't you at least offer me salsa for my breakfast burrito?)....I got no sauce, no ketchup, no napkins, nuthin'.OK, then to get out and go back east on North Avenue, you must basically repeat the maze-bullshit from above, only in the reverse. .You used to be able to exit onto Kostner, then turn left on North Avenue. .Now you are forced to either go west on Grand or North Avenue or go to Lowell, north .to Wabansia (past a high school) to Kildare to North Avenue. .Got all that? .Apparently the city thinks it's more desirable for us to drive around an entire neighborhood than to use the only (inexplicably) one-way alley in the entire neighborhood to get home from fucking McDonald's. .I felt like rat in a ghetto-maze, only with a soon-to-be-cold Egg McMuffin.So in a nutshell, if you live west of here, you can't get in. .If you live east of here, you can't get out. .And ya can't really go north, either. .It's maddening. .If you must go to THIS McDonald's, walk or take the bus, seriously. .From my house (at the halfway point between the two), I will just go down to the one at Kedzie/North. .I realize McDonald's and/or the city are trying to protect themselves from lawsuits from our shitty driving, and that badly designed intersection, but if it's that dangerous (which it is) then just DON'T BUILD IT THERE. .It's a square lot, yet needlessly complicated. .Grrr.\", 'Drive thru is clueless.

I can imagine that these kind of errors would happen if the restaurant was extremely busy but by looking at the people inside and the drive thru outside...the place was not busy so do they give poor service every time I go there?

She responded with \"We don\\'t have grilled meat, wait yeah ok grilled what else?\" Then I asked for Sprite. \"We\\'re out of Sprite.\" Ok please give me unsweet ice tea. \"OK Sweet tea.\" At that point, my headache was so bad I didn\\'t even try to ask for the frickin unsweet tea.

Then it was another 10 minutes just to give me a soda and 2 dipped cones!!! Everyone at the window was acting stupid like they had no idea what to do. NO one wanted to give there face at the window. Everyone including the manager was just walking around in circles back and fourth. Then finally a girl came to the window and asked what was our order ready to hand us food. I forgot to mention that the car in front of us waited so long he just took off and i didn\\'t see him receive anything. So i told her my order and she left. Then a boy comes up and asked us the same thing so i told him. I couldn\\'t believe it, but for the third time the manager goes to the window and asked us what we ordered. I told her .\"a large soda and two dipped cones\". WOW i cant believe the manager had to figure out our order after explaining it 2 times. She hands me the coke and like 5 minutes later a girl comes to the window and hands 2 dripping cones without napkins so i look at her like really? then she says \" Oh let me give you some napkins\".', \"I didn't like their drive thru service.\", \"This McDonald's has made a radical adjustment since this time last year. Employees are courteous and friendly. Orders are not only made correctly, but are double-checked for accuracy. Soda cups are wiped down individually before being handed out the drive-thru window. I am extremely impressed with my past dozen visits to this location. There are only two problems: Lobby is often messy (but with their cliental being almost entirely comprised of USC students, I don't fault the restaurant) and longish drive-thru wait times.. but what are you going to do when you have two order lanes open? Overall, really impressed with the turn-around here. Keep up the good work!\", \"Every time I come here, my booking for a party is messed up or my meal is incorrect or incomplete. I come because its close but there are closer. The Play place I no longer allow my kids in since the last few time they became ill. The bathroom in the play place has this extra tall toilet, why? Kids are the ones going to use it the most. Well, at least I can't say it was unexpected.\", \"Its a mcdonalds. The food is flash frozen boxed and prepared by lesser skilled persons who you hope don't spit in your food. The only reason im writing a review at all is cos this is the worst one I've ever been to in my life. Got screamed at by a homeless lady as I was walking in 'what am I gonna do about my lunch?!' Inside the ac was off and it was packed and sweaty/nasty. 3 homeless guys in there harassing everyone in line for money *not food* and it wouldn't be so bad but they were hitting us up over and over and over... and nobody asked them to leave. Will never come here again. Convinced this is an unspoken level of Dante's inferno...\", \"It's McDonald's what can you expect.The fact that they're open late is what I like about this location. They have two drive-thru windows and the waiting can get kind of long, which sucks when you are drunk and hungry.\", \"Went here on March 10th, and there NO Shamrock Shakes. They weren't sold out. The employees just had NO idea what I was talking about. SHAMROCK SHAKES!

It is slow, workers don't speak English well, order screen is damaged and 9/10 times, there is a homeless person begging at the speaker box and another homeless person begging at the pick-up window. .No exaggeration! Everytime, yes, everytime I have gone to this drive-thru, they have screwed up my order. So you'd better check what's in the bag before you drive off. The trick is to find that perfect timing of when to check what's in the bag, how to roll up your window to avoid the homeless beggar and how much time to take to examine your bag's contents without annoying the people behind you who have also been waiting for 20 minutes + in the same drive-thru. .This place is horrible.The food taste like McDonald's food...but over-cooked or under-cooked. .It is never just right. .Don't bother with the frozen yogurt either. .The machine must be faulty because it comes out like a sloppy mess. .The food here only taste good if you're drunk but you wouldn't be in the drive thru if you were drunk anyway! ;) I'd rather go to near-by Chano's Mexican Food.I have given this establishment multiple chances to prove me wrong but it has consistently under-delivered. .It is the worst McDonald's I have ever been to. .I challenge you to experience this review for yourself and you'll be surprised by its' truthful accuracy.Bottom line, I'd rather go hungry than go to this McDonald's. They should pay YOU to eat here. The homeless people only beg here, not eat here...and that's saying something about a place that delivers nothing.See you for dessert...\", \"This McDonald's needs a security guard because the weird homeless people corner you and the begging starts. The shock of them sneaking around the corner is too much that you immediately don't hear what they say, so you just say NO!!

This McDonald's is just weird.I only come here because my boyfriend like to make a late night run after work. .The drive thru people don't speak English and your order is always wrong. I don't know why they don't take debit or credit card after a certain time. They always ask for cash. I find it odd, that's all I'm saying. Some of the people I don't trust. They look shady as hell.This McDonald's is so odd!\", \"Many many late night munchies have been satisfied at this establishment. Other people complain about how they sometimes don't have everything in stock. I've only run into that situation 1 or 2 times since I'm not that picky when it comes to fast food. Beggers can't be choosers imo. I usually order a simple burger so they're bound to have that in stock. My friend always gets salads so sometimes they're out of the kind he usually gets. But again that has happened like 1 or 2 times at most.As for the food, even late at night the food is served hot so I'm definitely satisfied there. Inside is just like any other Mcdonalds with an indoor playpen for kiddies. Overall I haven't had any bad experiences with this place other than the occasional homeless person walking up to your car asking for money when you're sitting in the drive-thru at 2 am. But that has nothing to do with McDonalds, you can run into homeless people anywhere.\", 'This is the McDonald\\'s that my friends and I always go to since it\\'s the closest to our apartment but at the same time, it\\'s definitely the WORST one I\\'ve ever been to.One plus is that their drive-thru is open 24 hours but sadly, the later at night you go, the more often your choices are limited. For example, one day we were craving their vanilla cone but they said that their ice cream machine was off already so they couldn\\'t make it! Okay. What\\'s the point of staying open 24 hours if you can\\'t even give the customers the food they want?!The other day, I had a pretty bad dine-in experience. The lady behind the counter charged extra for big mac sauce on the McDouble which I have NEVER experienced before. Usually going through drive-thru, they never charge extra for a McDouble w/o the ketchup, w/ big mac sauce and shredded lettuce (a.k.a a Big Mac, but cheaper!). My boyfriend and I were pretty shocked when she told us we had to pay extra for the sauce and she claimed that they always do this which they really NEVER DO!!Then, this same lady proceeded to close the cash register before giving me my change! She told me to wait on the side so she can give it to me after she opens it for the next customer. So I patiently waited... and then she closed the cash register AGAIN after the next customer and totally forgot to give me my change!!!! So I had to remind her again to which she just laughed and semi-apologized and then finally gave me my change after like a decade of waiting! ARGH! Worst McDonalds worker ever!! Completely rude and horrible customer service skills! I totally agree with my boyfriend who said this McDonalds is very poorly managed. He even wrote a complaint to them a while back but they never responded. \"We love to see you smile?\" I beg to differ.', 'So incredibly peeved! I went to the drive-thru to grab a quick lunch before I went into the office. I bought 2 cheeseburgers, and when I got to my office, I found there was only ONE cheeseburger. This was supposed to be my lunch... the sticker on the bag that says \"Double Checked for Accuracy\" is just laughing at me right now. Either they didn\\'t double check it, or they don\\'t know how to count. I don\\'t understand the satisfaction of scamming 99 cents from customers, but whatever makes you sleep at night I guess.The only reason I ever go to this McDonalds is because it\\'s close to USC and close to my apartment. I really dislike this McDonalds. Really really dislike.OH.

AND also the last two times i went, which were in the past month (i dont usually go to mcD's i swear), they forgot my order. I literally waited 20+ minutes. And the worst thing is that the .workers there seem very reluctant to help you, so make sure you show them who's boss and demand your fkin food that they fkin forgot!!!!!!!!! I forget about how shitty they are when i get my food tho, because im glad the food is always hot and fresh and the nugz are crispy. I HATE STALE NUGGETS *AHEMLAX* but honestly besides the shitty service and blah workers, this is def one of the nicer mcdonalds out there. it's usually pretty clean and they also have a humungo playplace thing for kiddos. also, everybody comes here on thurs-sat nights cause who doesnt love a drunk mcdonalds meal and if you're a creeper, you can check out all the girls in slutty outfits coming from the row. ha. I can see the mcd's sign from where i live at usc too so obv i do come here still with the shitty service.

I went there at least once a week.\", \"Considering it's in a pretty crappy area, I could not give this place more than 3 stars. Additionally, it IS McDonald's. I went to the drive-thru the other morning to get an iced coffee and they were pretty busy (which is good).

Definitely one of the slowest drive thrus I've experienced but perhaps it was just an off day for them.

It\\'s a chain with no \"indie cred\", but it\\'s hard to deny that a sausage, egg and cheese biscuit is delicious even if it\\'s not served by a cool guy with a handlebar mustache.So I rolled up to the San Fernando location, just blocks away from the infamous Drew Street and former Avenues Gang stronghold. The drive through line was looooong and I thought, \"I\\'ll just go in!\" That\\'ll be quick, right?The interior was that edge-of-anarchy you only get on a Saturday in a sketchy corner of a big city. Kids, post-soccer games all jacked up on Cokes and orange slices, a dense crowd that stands a liiiiitle to close, a few vagrants and an overwhelmed staff that handles it fairly well.I finally left about 15 minutes later (yes, really), after several false alarms of \"Oh! I think that\\'s mine.\" .Ironically, my ORANGE JUICE is what held up the order while I watched the biscuit, McMuffin and hashy-b\\'s get cold. .I walked out politely but my head was spinning with entitled yuppie frustration and thoughts of \"Well, I\\'m never going in there again.\" One time, no joke, I got a cheeseburger with no burger! Kinda hilarious actually, and the manager came through for me with a TWO free cheeseburgers as an apology.

I'm hardly unsympathetic to the homeless, but if you've been here, you know what I'm talking about. Try it...it's quite an adventure. Def some regulars that set up camp who are just plain off, which can make it uncomfortable sometimes. I actually feel a bit sorry for the staff for all the daily crap they must have to endure.

I don't think anything special was going on, so uggghhhh.I had just finished moving all of my stuff from a U-haul down the street and was so tired and hot and all I wanted was a McFlurry and a burger. I think that was too much to handle. The McFlurry came out quickly. The burger? Not so much.Their weird coffee machine was busted (I don't understand why people want to eat those sugar drinks), and it was making this huge line. They also had about 40 people behind the counter and 20 of them trying to fix the machine. I lie, but you get the idea. So, I waited and waited and waited and waited for the burger, like 15 minutes. I hate to say stuff, and I could tell they were backed up so I kept thinking it was just getting there (other people were waiting a while, too). I finally did say something, and OH WADDYA KNOW. My burger was just sitting there at the end of the line.These two middle school boys had been waiting on something since before I had got there.

No big deal, I walked back up, explained what happened, and asked if I could have another without sauce. I didnt ask to replace mine, as I decided to give that one to a friend, and I just ordered a new one. A couple minutes later, I got it without sauce, but they also left out the bacon! So I had to go back to the counter, they gave me some bacon to put in but how hard is it to make these things? My second experience that i'd rather forget was when I ordered a grilled chicken chipotle snack wrap. Snack wraps are small as it is, but this one seemed to be folded in half of what is the normal size. I went and asked why it was so small and the guy got a manager who told me the chicken is weighed and it was fine. I have never had a snack wrap like that before or since. I wouldnt care if they had replaced it or gave me more chicken, but the fact that they stood behind it is why i'll never go back there unless I absolutely have to.

Not a problem, since I would never sit down and eat here anyway. However, the customer service is pretty darn poor, and my 1 star is based solely on that (I have no expectations for McDonald's foods).They do not have enough staff. There was exactly one person working in the 'kitchen' (making burgers), one person working soda/fries/ice creams (who I assumed to be the manager) and one person working the cashier. Now I understand that they're working minimum wage, but that does not excuse them to work so poorly. I had to repeat my order four times, and it took 30 minutes to be completed. Why? Because the cashier was VERY distracted from conversing with friends and coworkers.

Long waits on non-peak hours were common. Rather frustrating waiting 10 minutes for a chicken warp. I could swear that some days there only one person working the cashier and another in the kitchen.

I took a seat at the upstairs section and started with the McDouble. The McDouble included two cooked beef patties, cheese, pickles, ketchup and chopped onions, very satisfying for under 2 dollars. .I then switched between the hot crispy french fries and the McNuggets (small deep fried pieces of chicken) which I dipped in ketchup and their very tasty honey mustard sauce. .All in all I was very full and content with my meal, all of which cost me under $10, at any other local restaurant just a burger and fries would have run me more than $10 and most likely closer to $15.Although the food may not be on par, quality wise with other nearby eateries (Minetta Tavern, 100 Acres and Market Table), essentially you are getting a full meal at nearly half the price and a quarter of the time.

Since your McDonalds sucks so much please do not barricade drive thru attendees without an escape route. 2. Learn how to make 'fast' food and 3. Fire your entirely incompetent staff.

The service is terrible. It's worse than going to the DMV. In fact I rather go to the DMV, however sometimes I need some quick food and it's open 24/7. Everything about this place is absurd, the drive through makes you place the order at the window and they take 20 plus mins to get to you. They randomly close the doors when they feel like it even though it says 24/7 lobby. The employees need better training. There are mentally disabled homeless people that can do a better job of taking your order. This McDonald's needs an intervention...\", \"At this point, McDonald's is McDonald's. .They are the same restaurant after restaurant, but every now and then you get the 'special' ones with the playground for the kids or the fake me out 'Starbuck's Looking Cafí©', or the 2-lane drive thru. .This one has the latter. But don't think that means you are going to get better service. .Since I work down the street (and I obviously am not dieting), I have been to this location a number of times in the past month. .I generally get there around 12:30PM to beat all the construction workers, who are working across the street. .I was surprised to see the two-lane drive thru when I pulled up, but on two occasions this was a epic fail. I sat there wondering why thee outside lane was moving and the server at my lane kept telling me to hold on! .I was so frustrated I just decided to pull-up to the first window. I explained that I was NOT happy (and hungry)! The manager happened to be there and immediately got to the bottom if it. The server apologized and immediately took order. So why the one star? Because this happened twice AND the give you a 1-minute timer between windows to see of you get served within 60-seconds or you get a free sandwich. They never make it under 60 seconds and I have racked up 5 free sandwiches in a month. I've shared them with my co-workers, so at least someone is happy.\", \"The manager Rolando Rojas is the worst manager i have ever seen in my life! It was so uncomfortable to be having breakfast when the manager was screaming at his employees and i quote ' i am going to burn your eyes with coffee maybe you ll wake up' just because the lady didnt refill the coffee right then as he demanded. The owners should seriously do something about it, there is ways to be a manager. I wont ever come back here.\", '$7 + for a saturated fat meal. A rip off.

I just ate fries and a chicken sandwich and feel fat hahaah.', \"If a restaurant is open 24/7 which this one is, they understand that people have different schedules. People want to eat and enjoy their food at any hour. .How can you tell me I can't get McDonald fries at 7am 'cus you're only serving breakfast. I went back at 10:55am to order 'lunch' & the drive thru person made me wait till 11 for me to order even though there was no one in line for breakfast & they had already turned the menu display.\", 'Worst McDonalds I have been to in my life. Person at the drive thru stopped talking to me and when i rolled up to the windows they were extra rude. the total time it took me to get my meal was 20 minutes after i entered the drive thru.

After a few minutes of staring at her to see if she would take my order yells at the girl working the drive-thru to take our order.

He is loosing money having this person run his store.', \"I live very close, stop this morning at 5:50 am to get breakfast, they didn't open until 6:05 I didn't care about that. What I'm upset about is that the coffee was so bad.. I told her 3 milks and 8 sugars.. My mistake was that they ask me if I want it the milk and sugar all ready in the coffee. I said, ok. Oh no she was still sleepy I guess.. My coffee tasted like a cup of milk I had to drive Back again to ask to add more coffee, but I believe the coffee either was old, from last night, mix dome fresh with old one or they prepared with too much water. Oh well I was very disappointed.\", \"I mean, it's McDonald's. My expectations aren't very high. I just want two things: 1) My order right, and 2) not to be doused in scalding hot coffee.Yesterday I popped through the drive-thru here to grab a few things to munch on for the kiddos on the way to the store. It's easier for me to toss the kids in the car super early before breakfast and grab something on the way to beat the mobs. I ordered 3 sandwiches, 2 burritos, a coffee and a hashbrown. I get my receipt and I've only got 1 of everything listed. Grr. So I rectify it at the 2nd window, pay the difference, and have to pull up to the side and wait for the rest of the order. I park briefly to dole out the food, and no hashbrown :( The line at the drive-thru at this point was out of control and I wasn't about to unbuckle all 3 kids from their car seats to go in and fight over a $1 hashbrown. Whatever.This morning, I went through the drive-thru for a coffee after dropping dropping my kid off at school. The girl hands me my coffee with the lid half off, and of course, it's facing me. I'm doused in scalding hot coffee - all over my hands, legs, and of course, my brand new BlackBerry 9900 :\\\\ .I look at her in shock, and tell her 'OMG you just spilled coffee all over me!' Her response, 'Que te paso?' and a blank stare. I hand the cup back to her, she fixes the lid, wipes it off, gives me an annoyed look and kinda waves me away. No apology, no nothing. Again, I realize this is McDonald's. But damn!\", \"The food .is up to par with other McDonald's but the afternoon staff is young and inexperienced. They are not very attentive and don't really care about good customer service.Mediocre spot.\", \"We loooooove junk food and we love McDonalds BUT, this specific location was a total frustration today. .We get there and there's about 4-5 people in the line before us and. by the time we order, maybe another 5-6 waiting BEHIND us. .So we place our order with Roberto, who is only in charge of the orders and the register, he will not do anything else. .We then proceed to wait for our food, we were hungry and in a rush so this was the easiest (and yes, unhealthy) option, or so we thought at the time. So we wait and wait and then wait some more and, in the meantime, the 5 people that came in AFTER us got their food and left...it's like HELLO!!!! WTF!!!! so hubby complains to Roberto who proceeds to explain that he only takes the order nothing else...duh! then Miguel, the manager, comes over, doesn't like the fact that hubby's obviously not happy with the situation and tells him it'll be another few minutes....w/e.Finally our food is ready and, guess what?!?!?!?!?! it was WRONG!!! WTF again!!! hubby goes back to the counter and now he is not nice at all and asks 'so how long will it take for me to get my correct order?' to which Miguel, the manager, turns around, gets hubby's correct order and exchanges it for the wrong one....HUH!?!?!?!?!?! amazing!!! By the time we get our food we are beyond hungry and in a not so nice mood. Oh well, at least I have to say that Miguel came to our table, when the rush was over to apologize for the incident and to offer us tomorrow's lunch for free, but we gratefully declined.\", \"THIS PLACE IS A HOT MESS !! Disgusting !! The girl taking out order was scratching her cooter the whole time she was talking to us, she could not understand our coffee order to save her life AND after telling her six times I want 'sweet chili sauce' for my chicken she finally tells us they don't have any AND last but not least the fries were soggy and cold and the nuggets where refrigerator cold !!

Clean and modern interior seem out of place with kids sometimes around. I wouldn't mind returning since it's close by the highways - good meeting point especially with the big table they have.Big negative: It smells like a McDonald's. You don't normally want to smell that if you're ordering coffee.I agree with Michelle - going southbound on US 1 is not easy. But this McDonald's looks better than the one near the Starbucks a little bit farther north of this location on US 1.\", \"I actually got in an accident trying to leave this location.They need a turn arrow at this light. There isn't any.I give it 2 stars not because it is a McDonalds, but by comparing it to other McDonalds.The concept is fast food. It should be fast. It should be convenient. The location sucks because, again, of the traffic and light situation.The service is also slow, even for McDonald's standards.\", 'Came here for breakfast and there was total chaos. Customers were about to ript because the orders were taking forever. The ordering was super easy but once you ordered, the chaos started. Fifteen minutes later after ordering, we received our food.

They are so busy at this downtown location yet they manage to serve you your meal with a smile. They have so many different kinds of people, tourists, students, .workers and of course plenty of street bums/crazies. Yet they seem to function seamlessly. I come here because I am hooked on their McCafees and recently Frappuccinos and occasional small fries. It just amazes me that such a busy location can function so nicely.

It was horrible, the person who gave us our food ate half of our fries right in front of us! .And later, me and my dad called that Mcdonalds and found out that it was the manager who was eating our food. . .I'll never go back!\", \"My mom needed to meet a client to pick up documents and I was her chauffeur for the day. The lobby is really nice, as is all their locations in the Southwest that I've been to, due to recent renovations. Very modern, classy, and extremely clean. This location featured an opaque black and white rendition of the Las Vegas Strip on the glass separating the restaurant from Terrible's convenience store. The new digital menus are really nice as well and easy to read. I don't really eat at McDonald's, so I can't say much about the food. What I do usually order and enjoy was their Vanilla Cone. Delicious non-fat vanilla soft serve in a light and crispy cone. The best part of this location is the fact that it is one of the very few corporate stores in the valley and offers the Vanilla Cone at just $0.49 ($0.53 after sales tax)!! What an awesome deal! Especially when franchised locations charge $1 and up.So, based on the nice, welcoming lobby and consistently delicious Cone, I have no complaints.

WTF?!I didn\\'t know how to react because she looked at my receipt and threw it away without addressing me. .I went \"um...ok...\" and backed away from the counter to fill my tea. .I have no clue what I did to piss this employee off but my friend who came with me, asked me what the heck happened. .I said \"I have no clue, I\\'m just missing my fries...\" .My friend was nice and *itchy enough to go up to the counter, grab the attention of a different employee and told him we were missing our fries.But honestly, what is wrong with you? .I\\'m SORRY you were having a bad day but that doesn\\'t excuse you from taking it out on a customer who was trying to be nice about an honest mistake that can be easily fixed. .Not a big deal, I paid for fries and I have an incomplete order. .So chill, geez.---------ENCOUNTER #23 friends and I came here for smoothies. .One of my friends ordered a big mac, nuggets and fries. .Everyone else got our orders. .My friend waited 20 minutes for his order to be done. .No lie, we looked at the time on the receipt.You\\'re thinking, um yea maybe they were cooking it. .No...In that 20 minutes, we saw 5 employees goofing off, bickering with each other, throwing towels at each other, and basically... being extremely unprofessional. .They didn\\'t even do this in the back were customers cant see, they did this all in front of us, just on the other side of the counter. .Based on the manager\\'s asking where the order is, they seem to have forgotten about the order.I don\\'t care if you do this at work, but can you do this when no one is waiting for their food? .It\\'s really awkward to be standing and waiting while watching you goof off AND have your manager ask the team where our order is... THREE times.I really felt embarrassed for the manager because this just reflects badly on him but he really should be more assertive and keep his team in check. .For his credit, he did give us a coupon for a free dessert of our choice...which honestly is nothing because I dont ever order a pie, cone, or sundae.oh and our smoothies were not filled all the way to the top... .mine was 75% full.', 'Every time I come here they mess up my order....I NEVER leave the drive thru window before checking any more....', \"Don't go here if you're looking for fast food.

With tons of flat screens all over the place. Another big plus to this McDonald's is that they've got free Wi-Fi (while most hotels charge ridiculous fees), so if and when you have your laptop you can deal with business while munching on some fries.Even though it's smack dab on the strip, there's plenty of parking too!\", \"Okay so I came in here yesterday around 4:15 P.M. I took a while trying to make up my mind. .I had seen a commercial about the mozzarella sticks. SO I thought I would try that, a .McDouble and a medium French fries. When I ordered I started with the mozzarella sticks. .The cashier thought I said chicken McNuggets. .I corrected her and said the mozzarella sticks. .Then I also ordered the McDouble and the medium French fries. .My order was rung up and I got my order withing 5 minutes. That's good. .Bad- I can't for the life of me find where the salt, pepper and ketchup is on the first floor. If they have it on the second floor I don't remember.

I looked in the bag and was surprised at what I saw. .In my bag was a medium order of French fries, 4 chicken McNuggets, a McDouble, and a pack of marinara sauce. .I used the marinara sauce for the chicken.

After asking if she was going to be of help, she refused, saying to call back tomorrow to talk to someone else and hung up on me.

Same food as any other McDonald's & waitresses are friendly!\", 'Two points right out of the gate: 1. Thuggery knows no race (lily white frat boys from the suburbs can be just as vulgar and aggressive as any group with a gang mentality) 2. Rating a McDonald\\'s and McDonald\\'s food isn\\'t really an essential service; people generally know what they\\'re getting - menu and quality wise - going in. The purpose of this review is mostly about the safety factor. People need to know (and I think locals already do) that, depending on the time of day (night), this place is marginally dangerous. Over my last three visits to Chicago, I\\'ve noticed this neighborhood being overrun by flash mobs who do more looting, aggressive panhandling, and fighting than choreographed performing. In fact, this particular McDonald\\'s had to be closed down for several hours a couple months ago while police attempted to restore order. The Water Tower Place Mall about a block away has seen an increase in gang activity lately, including the arrest of some armed teenagers. This isn\\'t just my take (check out some of the other reviews of this place and this neighborhood). Many are pointing out that the Mag Mile is slowly becoming the \"Mug Mile.\" And this McDonald\\'s seems to be ground zero for Hip Hop Nation as they pour off the Red Line after taking up two seats on the subway while grandma has to stand. Apologists and the agenda driven will say (and have said): \"These kids are guilty of nothing other than being black in a predominantly white neighborhood.\" Really? Since when does being authentically \"black\" include screaming nonstop obscenities with little kids around (black and white)? Since when did Chicago get so soft on youth crime? Since when did it become open season on civility? [Since when did my reviews start reading like the rantings of some terrified reactionary/fascist?] While it\\'s mildly funny that Katelyn, Emily, Ashley, and their dolly buying mommies must sometimes contend with this thuggery after they leave the American Girl Doll store, nobody (not even the over-privileged, country club set) should have to endure this genuinely menacing behavior. And youth thugs (of any race) should NOT be permitted to turn this area into the \"Wild mid-West.\" Just a thought, Rahm - do what you want with it.', \"I wanted to grab breakfast one morning before work since it's just across the street, but the restaurant was filled with homeless people! It's like their hangout spot... I waited a lot longer than I needed to just to order. If they didn't have bums loitering around, maybe would have added one more star. The staff is not the problem, they look like they actually have to deal with a lot if problematic people. They should focus on making the place a little pleasant for their guest. No one wants to eat their burger while having to endure the smell if urine lingering off a homeless person.\"]\n"
